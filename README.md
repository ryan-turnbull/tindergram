# Tindergram

Hello!

### Getting started

To run the application, simply run

`yarn dev`

## Exercise notes

I'm going to keep my TODO list here and mark it off as I go. You'll be able to reference commits, but this hopefully gives you an insight into how I went through and tackled the problem.

I think i'll use a basic React app w/ TS, Vite, NextUI, Tailwind. I'm mainly choosing these technologies because I'm comfortable with them and want to keep the submission to ~4 hours.

[x] Setup app, packages & git repository
[] Host on vercel if i get the time
[] Setup my basic layout and pages. A view for searching, swiping between images, and then a view where the user can view all their past liked images.
[] Search bar connected to data source, incl. state management of what is necessary
[] Pull data through into a grid like view, with a like/dislike button on each grid cell. When clicked, it'll open in a full view
[] Full screen image view
[] Fancy animations
